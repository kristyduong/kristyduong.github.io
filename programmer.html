    <p class="w3-center">Hello. This page is still under construction, but here is some relevant coursework I have done in the meantime: Web Applications (CS142), Principles in Computer Systems (CS110), Computer Systems from the Ground Up (CS107E), Programming Abstractions (CS106B), Probability for Computer Scientists (CS109)<br> Some projects that I have done include building a Raspberry Pi shell, a magic mirror, and a basic photo application. The animations for the magic mirror were supported by a library my project team wrote on top of the code for the Raspberry Pi shell. The photo application was developed using the MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS) stack. The application included login services, photo uploading, commenting, liking, and activity feeds. I currently work as a web developer on the Openproof Project at the Stanford Center for the Study of Language and Information. The project focuses on developing applications to teach logic and consists of three software packages. The project team has recently been rebuilding the project website to support more features and a cleaner design. My tasks have included developing components for the client-side and writing services for the server-side. I worked with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including JQuery) on the frontend and Java with a Jersey-Jackson framework and an SQL database on the backend. Additionally, I was formerly webmaster of Common Origins Urban Dance Team.</p>
