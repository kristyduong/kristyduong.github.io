      <p><a href="https://defysilenceunderalliance.wordpress.com/" class="no-underline w3-text-blue">Defy Silence Under Alliance</a> (DSUA) is an education activist group whose primary goal is to "to hold the Alhambra Unified School District (AUSD) accountable for its actions and to ensure that students are receiving a quality education." The group formed as a result of the actions of AUSD administration during the summer of 2015, which include, but are not limited to, the censorship of a student newspaper, the threat of arrest towards students, and a lack of transparency to the general public. Their actions brought the attention of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Student Press Law Center (SPLC). Over fifty articles were published over the summer regarding the district by various news sources including World Journal, MTV, LAist, and Pasadena Star News. More details regarding the issue can be found <a href="https://defysilenceunderalliance.wordpress.com/about/" class="no-underline w3-text-blue">here</a>.</p>

      <p> My role in this group was very fluid, ranging from writing press releases and articles to communicating with people who contacted the group for various reasons. However, every part of my job involved great attention to detail, clear communication, and teamwork. I learned more about California Education Code and journalistic rights than I ever anticipated. There was so much planning put into everything that was done, and this became something like a full-time job for me. It truly was work that was worth doing.</p>
