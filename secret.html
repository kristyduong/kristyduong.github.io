      <p>The Secret Society (though not so secret anymore) was an organization at my high school that was inspired by <a href="https://improveverywhere.com/" class="no-underline w3-text-blue">Improv Everywhere</a>. Despite its cryptic and creative name, it was created to make people smile. We would put up posters with bad academic puns and write thank you notes to the underappreciated, but we would also play the occasional good-spirited prank. Though my partners-in-crime are no longer with me, I still carry the spirit of The Secret Society on my college campus.</p>
