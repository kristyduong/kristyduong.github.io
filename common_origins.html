      <p>I started dancing in January 2016. Without any prior dance experience, I joined Stanford's only non-audition urban dance team Common Origins (CO). When I started my undergraduate career, I resolved to try at least one new thing every quarter to optimize my college experience, so in a room full of strangers, I attended CO's Winter Welcome Workshop. I was terrible to say the least, and I almost decided not to come back. However, refusing to quit without giving it a proper chance, I decided to continue dancing. I attended the remainder of the team's open workshops and fundamentals trainings and ended up committing to perform that quarter. I struggled. Everything was new to me from the people to the dance moves to the blocking. However, I was met with patience and understanding. No one cared that I hadn't danced before or that I was messing up. What mattered is that I improved, and the choreographers were more than happy to help. I was terrified before my first performance, but I remember telling myself that I felt this way because it mattered. By no means was my performance perfect, but it was so much better than that first workshop.</p>

      <p>That quarter soon turned into another and another. My time as a dancer taught me so much about community, movement, teamwork, and self-expression. Dance gradually became an integral part of my life from the summer days spent learning to choreograph to three hour parking garage practices spent bringing a set together with my team. It was a humbling moment when I was chosen to be choreographer and elected as co-president. Dance is something that has seen me through my best and my worst. It has been a journey of self-improvement. I use dance to tell stories-- stories about sadness, frustration, hope. I stay for the people-- the community of people who find joy in the art of movement. My time on this team has moved cyclically-- learn, block, clean, perform-- but it always manages to surprise me too. I no longer dance for a stage anymore, but I cherish the lessons I learned and the people I met along the way.</p>
