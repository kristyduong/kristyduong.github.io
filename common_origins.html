      <p>I started dancing in January 2016. Without any prior dance experience, I joined Stanford's only non-audition urban dance team <a href="https://web.stanfordedu/group/commonorigins/index.html" class="no-underline w3-text-blue">Common Origins</a> (CO). When I started my undergraduate career, I resolved to try at least one new thing every quarter to optimize my college experience, so in a room full of strangers, I attended CO's Winter Welcome Workshop. I was terrible to say the least, and I almost decided not to come back. However, refusing to quit without giving it a proper chance, I decided to continue dancing. I attended the remainder of the team's open workshops and fundamentals trainings and ended up committing to perform that quarter. I struggled. Everything was new to me from the people to the dance moves to the blocking. However, I was met with patience and understanding. No one cared that I hadn't danced before or that I was messing up. What mattered is that I improved, and the choreographers were more than happy to help. I was terrified before my first performance, but I remember telling myself that I felt this way because it mattered. By no means was my performance perfect, but it was so much better than that first workshop.</p>

      <!--<p>I never imagined that almost two years later, I would become one of the leaders of this dance team. This team taught me about the importance of community, and I have learned so much about movement, teamwork, and self-expression. Dance has become an integral part of my life, and I wouldn't have it any other way. </p>-->
      <p>I am still dancing a year later thanks to all the people I met when I joined CO. They are the ones who helped me to grow as both a dancer and a person. I learned so much about movement and teamwork and family. Dance became an integral part of my life. As I started to choreograph, I learned more about myself and began to develop my own style. From all the late night practices and summer days spent choreographing, dance became something meaningful to me.</p>
