      <p>My journey through dance has certainly been one of self-improvement, and along the way, there were several pieces of choreography and dance projects that show snapshots of who I was at the time, in both my ability as a dancer and who I was as a person. Choreography is something very personal to me, and each piece is the reflection of a thought or a memory or a wish.</p>
      <p>During Summer 2016, Common Origins had a series of Summer Dance Challenges to encourage its members to explore choreography and to continue dancing over the break. These are a couple of my first attempts at choreography.</p>
