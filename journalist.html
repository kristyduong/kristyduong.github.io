      <p>My became involved with journalism my sophomore year of high school where I was primarily a features writer for our student newspaper <i>The Matador</i>. During my time on staff, I would fill different roles including assistant news editor, summer web editor, news editor, and finally editor-in-chief. I would cover local stories such as school productions and new classes, but I would also cover more national issues such as the Ferguson shooting, teacher tenure, and Common Core. Some of the articles I wrote would also be published in the local newspaper the <a href="http://www.alhambrachamber.org/around-alhambra-archive/" class="no-underline w3-text-blue">Around Alhambra</a>. As an editor, I worked closely with the staff to produce each issue of the paper-- teaching new writers the ropes of newswriting, sitting down with individual writers who needed help with articles, and building a community among the staff members. The newsroom would become like a second home to my co-editor and I as we would watch the sunset from the windows while still copyediting proofs. However, the effort was well worth it as our newspaper and staff members would repeatedly be recognized by the National Scholastic Press Association (NSPA).</p>

      <p>When I became a college student, I briefly wrote for <a href="http://www.stanforddaily.com/" class="no-underline w3-text-blue">The Stanford Daily</a> as a part of the news section, where the story topics were broader than I was used to, but the style of news writing was still familar. My <i>Stanford Daily</i> articles can be found <a href="http://www.stanforddaily.com/author/kristyduong/" class="no-underline w3-text-blue">here</a>.</p>

      <p>My archived online articles from my time on <i>The Matador</i> staff are indefinitely lost because the year following my graduation, Alhambra Unified School District decided to host <i>The Matador Online</i> on its servers rather than the third-party server it was previously hosted on and gave the staff one hour of notice before the website hosting expired, giving staff members little to no time to back up files before the server went down. The articles that I still have access to can be found <a href="https://kristyduongthematador.wordpress.com/portfolio/" class="no-underline w3-text-blue">here</a>.</p>
